_deptry_ is a command line tool to check for issues with dependencies in a Python project, such as obsolete or missing dependencies. It supports the following types of projects:

- Projects that use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and a corresponding _pyproject.toml_ file
- Projects that use [PDM](https://pdm.fming.dev/latest/) and a corresponding _pyproject.toml_ file
- Projects that use a _requirements.txt_ file according to the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/) standards

Dependency issues are detected by scanning for imported modules within all Python files in a directory and its subdirectories, and comparing those to the dependencies listed in the project's requirements.

## Quickstart

### Installation

To add _deptry_ to your project, run one of the following commands:

```shell
# Install with poetry
poetry add --group dev deptry

# Install with pip
pip install deptry
```

> **Warning**: When using pip to install _deptry_, make sure you install it within the virtual environment of your project. Installing _deptry_ globally will not work, since it needs to have access to the metadata of the packages in the virtual environment.

### Prerequisites

_deptry_ should be run within the root directory of the project to be scanned, and the project should be running in its own dedicated virtual environment.

### Usage

To scan your project for dependency issues, run:

```shell
deptry .
```

Example output could look as follows:

```console
Scanning 2 files...

foo/bar.py:1:0: DEP004 'numpy' imported but declared as a dev dependency
foo/bar.py:2:0: DEP001 'matplotlib' imported but missing from the dependency definitions
pyproject.toml: DEP002 'pandas' defined as a dependency but not used in the codebase
Found 3 dependency issues.
```

### Configuration

_deptry_ can be configured by using additional command line arguments, or by adding a `[tool.deptry]` section in _pyproject.toml_. For more information, see the [Usage and Configuration](https://fpgmaas.github.io/deptry/usage/) section of the documentation..
