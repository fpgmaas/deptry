_deptry_ is a command line tool to check for issues with dependencies in a Python project, such as obsolete or missing dependencies. It supports the following types of projects:

- Projects that use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and a corresponding _pyproject.toml_ file
- Projects that use a _requirements.txt_ file according to the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/) standards

Dependency issues are detected by scanning for imported modules within all Python files in a directory and its subdirectories, and comparing those to the dependencies listed in the project's requirements.

## Quickstart

### Installation

_deptry_ can be added to your project with 

```shell
poetry add --group dev deptry
```

or with 

```
<activate virtual environment>
pip install deptry
```

> **Warning**
> When using pip to install _deptry_, make sure you install it within the virtual environment of your project. Installing _deptry_ globally will not work, since it needs to have access to the metadata of the packages in the virtual environment.

### Prerequisites

_deptry_ should be run withing the root directory of the project to be scanned, and the project should be running in its own dedicated virtual environment.

### Usage

To scan your project for dependency issues, run

```sh
deptry .
```

_deptry_ can be configured by using additional command line arguments, or 
by adding a `[tool.deptry]` section in _pyproject.toml_.

For more information, see the [documentation](https://fpgmaas.github.io/deptry/).
